# Laguerre-MPC
Laguerre-based MPC simulation code

The vehicle kinematics simulation based on Laguerre-MPC can be directly realized by running the main script VehKineControl_Lmpc, and all simulation experiments are conducted in the software environment of MATLAB R2023a.



The implementation of the Model Predictive Control (MPC) algorithm refers to the open-source code repository (https://gitee.com/chunshan_ma/MPC.git). 

The implementation of Laguerre basis functions is modified based on the open-source code Optimized_Adaptive_MPC developed by Kebbati et al. (2021), with the original code available at https://github.com/yassinekebbati/Optimized_adaptive_MPC.git. The corresponding research paper of the original code is: Kebbati Y, Puig V, Ait-Oufroukh N, et al. Optimized adaptive MPC for lateral control of autonomous vehicles [C]//2021 9th International Conference on Control, Mechatronics and Automation (ICCMA). IEEE, 2021: 95-103.


Meanwhile, the theories and implementation methods related to Laguerre basis functions in this study are referenced from the monograph: Wang L. Model Predictive Control System Design and Implementation Using MATLAB [M]. London: Springer, 2009.
